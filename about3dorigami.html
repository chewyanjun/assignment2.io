3D origami, also known as Chinese origami to golden venture origami, is a type of paper craft that starts in a way

somewhat similar to standard origami, but instead <b>creates a three-dimensional (3D) model of an object through the

use of connected paper triangles</b>. 3D origami begins with the creation of numerous small paper triangles, which are then 

used to create the actual sculpture. These triangles are created using a relatively small strip of paper that is folded in a 

particular way to create a triangular form with two “tabs” and two “pockets” on opposite sides of the triangle. This allows each 

triangle to be inserted into another triangle, by inserting the tabs into the pockets, allowing them to be joined together.This is a 

fairly time-consuming art form, but the final pieces are more durable and can be displayed more easily than many 2D origami forms.

<h1 style="font-size: 200%;">History of 3D Origami</h1>

<div style="border: 1px solid black">
<pre>

The origin of this art form is debatable, though it is typically linked to a Chinese source, rather than standard

two-dimensional (2D) origami that has a Japanese background. This type of origami was first noticed in the US and

some other areas when Chinese immigrants, illegally smuggled into the US on a ship named the Golden Venture, were

detained for a period of time. During their detention in the US, they created numerous origami sculptures and gave

them to those who helped them.
